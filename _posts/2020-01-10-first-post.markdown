We all have to start somewhere, right ? So this is where _Bad Gateway_ starts. First, let me re-introduce myself : my name is Lucas and I’m a software engineer specialized in mobile apps development.

I’m currently working for [ARTE](https://arte.tv), an European TV channel with an ambitious online offer available on desktop, mobile apps (iOS and Android) and smart TV (HbbTV, tvOS and Android TV).

Lately, I have red an article named [_Software disenchantment_](http://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) : this excellent post summed up quite well _the disease that currently plagues software development_.

I mean : if you want to take the pride for good apps, you have to take the responsibility for bad ones. So let’s consider that we (_people developing softwares_) are all responsible for the bad choices and wrong trends that become popular and spread among development teams around the world.

**That is why I would like to take the floor, at my own scale, and share my thoughts about software development. **

Some future posts might be a bit philosophical but I would like to stay concrete as much as possible and talk about _methods, approaches and tools_ that worked for me and for people I met.

Bringing quality apps back in the game is certainly not easy and this post might look like a tiny effort to change this. 

But we all have to start somewhere, right ?
