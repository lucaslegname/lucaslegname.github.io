Using the right tool for the right purpose can save your life. Or at least prevent you from wasting time (and that‚Äôs already a lot). Sometimes we are all too busy shipping new features to spend hours on the web looking for new softwares.

But we should never underestimate the time we can save once we have the right method to _specify, validate or debug_ our applications. And the right method is often tied to the right tool.

In my everyday work life I'm generally working on multiple projects at the same time so it's quite important to have helpers to organize my thoughts and to remind me about important topics. But I also need tools that allow me to analyze and debug mobile apps.

For example, most apps now rely on APIs and a good use of them is a great source of optimization. But if you don‚Äôt write the code yourself, how can you tell that the developers you are working with used the right endpoint with the right parameters at the right place ?

Fortunately, there are tools for that.

_Note : in order to keep this post relevant, I will try to update it as I include more tools in my everyday routine._

### <a href="https://setapp.com" target="_blank">SetApp</a> üíé
You can think of **SetApp** as the Netflix of Mac applications. It is not really a tool but a service that allows you to use a selection of cool and always up-to-date apps with a single subscription.

The app selection is pretty nice and contains a lot of developer-oriented tools. This service can also be very convenient if you want to test a pricey app before buying a licence.

Some of the tools I will talk about in this post are part of the SetApp bundle.

_Price : 9.99$ / month_  
_Available on macOS_

### <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com" target="_blank">GoodTask</a> üìã
Unless you have an extraordinary memory, chances are that you already use a todo list app. I personally use **GoodTask** : not only it provides the basic list management features but it also contains a few more convenient functions like tag management and smart lists.

Another cool point : it synchronizes with the stock Apple Reminder and Calendar apps.

_Price : 19.99$ on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1143437985?mt=8)_  
_(included in the SetApp subscription)_  
_Available on macOS_

### <a href="https://mitmproxy.org" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a> üîç
In this list, **mitmproxy** is probably my favorite tool, it is also certainly the less user-friendly. The purpose of this software is simple : allowing you to see all requests coming in and out of your device.

You might need a tutorial to get started but once you get used to it, it‚Äôs hard to work without it. More than just seeing requests, it is possible to filter and even modify them using Python scripts.

Since mitmproxy is a very powerful tool, I will write a dedicated post about some advanced usages.

_Price : free_  
_Available on macOS and Linux_

### <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> üíæ
You are probably already familiar with this one but still **Visual Studio Code** is very nice code editor. Better polished than Atom in my opinion, there is a lot to like with all its cool features and extensions.

Even if the choice of building the app using Electron is perfectible, I did not notice big performance issues on my Macbook Air.

_Price : free_  
_Available on macOS, Windows and Linux_

### <a href="https://www.iterm2.com" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> üì∫
Using the terminal can sometimes be a painful experience and iTerm2 is a nice tool to make it better. With useful features like split panes, search and history : it‚Äôs hard to go back to the classic Mac terminal once you tried this one.
