My name is Lucas and I’m a french software engineer specialized in mobile apps development.

I started studying development a dozen years ago, after my studies I first worked as a developer and I'm now managing development for a VOD app available on iOS and Android.

The company I’m currently working for is [ARTE](https://arte.tv), an European TV channel with an ambitious online offer available on desktop, mobile apps (iOS and Android) and smart TV (HbbTV, tvOS and Android TV).

As I strongly believe that sharing knowledge is a key to improvement, I decided to start sharing my thoughts and observations. I hope you will enjoy them.
