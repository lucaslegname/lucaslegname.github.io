## elityst ðŸŽ¶
When Iâ€™m not writing about software development, chances are that Iâ€™m blogging about music. [elityst](https://www.elityst.com/) is a webzine I created with my brother and my best friend that mainly talks about _art, music and movies_.

If you missed the fact that I live in France, I must warn you : the website is in french.

## Anytram ðŸšƒ
My first mobile app project was a navigation app allowing people living in Strasbourg (France) to get tram and bus schedules. Based on the open API from the CTS (the local transport company), the app has been built using **Xamarin**.

I started with the iOS version and never finished the Android oneâ€¦ sorry. ðŸ˜…

~~[ðŸ“² App Store](#)~~ _Sorry, this app is not available anymore_

## WalletGenerator.net ðŸ’°
A few years ago, I followed [@MichaelMure](https://github.com/MichaelMure) in this crypto-currency project. The idea was to ease the process of creating paper wallets for new crypto-currencies.

Several years and 400 stars later, I think it kind of worked.
